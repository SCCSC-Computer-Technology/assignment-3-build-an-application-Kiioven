I can see the data of the states but the project isn't quite finished. To be frank, I'm not one to talk
and I couldn't finish mine in time either but it's just what i noticed. There's also no code comments so some 
areas of the code could be hard to understand their functionality. 
i did like the data though, from what it seems it looks correct.
