Code Review for Kiioven

Upon downloading and running the program I was given build errors but it still ran the program. I'm not sure, but selecting a state resulted in the state Alabama being replaced with the proviously selected state. Also both Form2 and Form3 loaded blank while the program was running.

The layout of the controls on Form1 and Form2 were simple and easy for users to follow. I think the program overall would have displayed the information and data in a concise way for users. I didn't see the options for the users to sort and filter the data while running and on Form3 there are no controls to allow users this option. I also think that renaming the Forms to better clearly describe it would be helpful for those reviewing the program.
